This is a lab based on a tutorial by Arun Gupta that can be found here:
http://blog.arungupta.me/docker-mysql-persistence/

In the file docker_run it is line 11:
v ~/mariadb/alarmservicedb/data:/var/lib/mysql \

that makes mariadb data persistent between containers 
(not only start/stop)

IMPORTANT NOTICE!
This solution is not very portable. See next example using data-only
containers
