 I was assuming that you could just override "entrypoint" of a  Dockerimage 
 using 
 --entrypoint ./wait-for-it-sh 
 
 and that the original command of  the Dockerimage was going to be passed 
 along automatically to the wrapper-script as the last argument.

This assumtion was wrong it seems. You need to pass the command for running
 the application explicitly to the wait-for-it.sh script.
